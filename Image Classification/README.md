## Melanoma Classification

The input data consists of three sets - train, test, valid each in turn consisting of two folders - Melanoma and others. 

This model helps in classifying an input image whether it is melanoma or not. 

melanoma_cnn.ipynb gives a test accuracy of **80%**. 

ImageDataGenerator API is used for data augmentation but it didn't improve the accuracy in this case. 

melanoma_cnn_confusionmatrix gives a representation of confusion matrix.
